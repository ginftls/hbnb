### ‚öôÔ∏è Part 2: Business Logic & API  
The **Business Logic (BL) Layer** and **API** are key components of the HBnB system, ensuring efficient handling of user requests and data processing. This section details how the business logic is structured and how the API provides a seamless interface for external interactions.  

#### üîπ Business Logic Layer  
- Implements core functionalities such as **user authentication, property management, and review processing**.
- Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to encapsulate logic and enforce data consistency.
- Interacts with the **database layer** to store and retrieve information efficiently.
- Implements error handling to ensure **data integrity** and **robust performance**.

#### üîπ API Implementation  
- Built using **Flask** as a lightweight framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Follows **RESTful principles**, making it scalable and easy to interact with.
- Provides **CRUD operations** for major entities such as **Users, Places, and Reviews**.
- Implements **JWT authentication** for secure access control.

#### üåç API Endpoints Overview  
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users` | Retrieve all users |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/users` | Create a new user |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users/<user_id>` | Retrieve a specific user |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/users/<user_id>` | Update user details |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/users/<user_id>` | Delete a user |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/places` | Retrieve all places |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/places` | Create a new place |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/places/<place_id>` | Retrieve a specific place |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/places/<place_id>` | Update place details |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/places/<place_id>` | Delete a place |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/reviews` | Retrieve all reviews |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/reviews` | Submit a new review |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/reviews/<review_id>` | Retrieve a specific review |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/reviews/<review_id>` | Update a review |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/reviews/<review_id>` | Delete a review |

# HBnB Project - Part 3: Enhanced Backend with Authentication and Database Integration

Welcome to Part 3 of the HBnB project! In this section, you will enhance the backend of the application by integrating user authentication, implementing role-based authorization, and transitioning from in-memory storage to a relational database using SQLAlchemy and SQLite for development. Later, you'll configure MySQL for production environments. This part will set the foundation for a secure, scalable, and production-ready backend system.

## Objectives

### 1. **Authentication and Authorization:**
   - Implement JWT-based user authentication using **Flask-JWT-Extended**.
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) using the `is_admin` attribute for specific endpoints.

### 2. **Database Integration:**
   - Replace in-memory storage with **SQLite** for development using **SQLAlchemy** as the ORM.
   - Prepare the system for **MySQL** or other production-grade RDBMS.

### 3. **CRUD Operations with Database Persistence:**
   - Refactor all CRUD operations to interact with the new persistent database (SQLite during development, MySQL for production).

### 4. **Database Design and Visualization:**
   - Design and visualize the database schema using **mermaid.js**.
   - Ensure correct relationships between entities like Users, Places, Reviews, and Amenities.

### 5. **Data Consistency and Validation:**
   - Enforce data validation and constraints within the database models to ensure consistency.

---

## Structure of the Project

The tasks in this part of the project are organized progressively to help you build a complete, secure, and database-backed backend system:

1. **Modify the User Model to Include Password:**
   - Modify the User model to securely store passwords using **bcrypt2** and update the user registration process.

2. **Implement JWT Authentication:**
   - Secure the API by implementing JWT tokens. Only authenticated users should be able to access protected endpoints.

3. **Implement Authorization for Specific Endpoints:**
   - Implement role-based access control (RBAC) to restrict certain actions to administrators.

4. **SQLite Database Integration:**
   - Transition from in-memory storage to **SQLite** as the persistent database during development.

5. **Map Entities Using SQLAlchemy:**
   - Map existing entities (User, Place, Review, Amenity) to the database using **SQLAlchemy** and define relationships correctly.

6. **Prepare for MySQL in Production:**
   - Towards the end of this phase, configure the application to use **MySQL** in production environments while using **SQLite** for development.

7. **Database Design and Visualization:**
   - Use **mermaid.js** to create entity-relationship diagrams (ERDs) for the database schema and ensure all relationships are properly visualized.

---

## Final Deliverables

- A backend system with JWT-based authentication and role-based access control.
- A database-backed system with persistent storage using SQLite and preparation for MySQL deployment.
- A well-designed and visualized relational database schema.
- A secure, scalable, and production-ready backend ready for further enhancements.
