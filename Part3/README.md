### üìò [Part 1: UML Diagrams](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/tree/main/Part1)  
We started the development of the HBnB Evolution application by creating a detailed blueprint. This technical documentation compiles essential diagrams and explanations, serving as a comprehensive guide to the system‚Äôs architecture, design, and implementation steps, from user interactions to database operations.  

#### Key Points:  
1. [High-level architecture](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/0-%20High-Level_Package_Diagram.md) with a package diagram outlining the three layers and the use of the **Facade Pattern**.

2. [Detailed diagrams of the business logic layer](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/1-%20Detailed_Class_Diagram_for_Business_Logic_Layer.md) illustrating key entities, their relationships, and their role in the system.

3. [Sequence diagrams for key API interactions](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_API_calls.md) depicting critical operations such as:  
    - [User registration](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_user_registration.md)  
    - [Place creation](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_place_creation.md)  
    - [Review submission](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_review_submission.md)  
    - [Fetching places](https://github.com/MaKSiiMe/holbertonschool-hbnb/blob/main/Part1/2-%20Sequence_diagram_for_fetching_a_list_of_places.md)

### ‚öôÔ∏è Part 2: Business Logic & API  
The **Business Logic (BL) Layer** and **API** are key components of the HBnB system, ensuring efficient handling of user requests and data processing. This section details how the business logic is structured and how the API provides a seamless interface for external interactions.  

#### üîπ Business Logic Layer  
- Implements core functionalities such as **user authentication, property management, and review processing**.
- Uses **object-oriented programming (OOP)** principles to encapsulate logic and enforce data consistency.
- Interacts with the **database layer** to store and retrieve information efficiently.
- Implements error handling to ensure **data integrity** and **robust performance**.

#### üîπ API Implementation  
- Built using **Flask** as a lightweight framework to handle HTTP requests and responses.
- Follows **RESTful principles**, making it scalable and easy to interact with.
- Provides **CRUD operations** for major entities such as **Users, Places, and Reviews**.
- Implements **JWT authentication** for secure access control.

#### üåç API Endpoints Overview  
| HTTP Method | Endpoint | Description |
|------------|---------|-------------|
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users` | Retrieve all users |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/users` | Create a new user |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/users/<user_id>` | Retrieve a specific user |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/users/<user_id>` | Update user details |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/users/<user_id>` | Delete a user |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/places` | Retrieve all places |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/places` | Create a new place |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/places/<place_id>` | Retrieve a specific place |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/places/<place_id>` | Update place details |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/places/<place_id>` | Delete a place |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/reviews` | Retrieve all reviews |
| `POST` | `/api/v1/reviews` | Submit a new review |
| `GET` | `/api/v1/reviews/<review_id>` | Retrieve a specific review |
| `PUT` | `/api/v1/reviews/<review_id>` | Update a review |
| `DELETE` | `/api/v1/reviews/<review_id>` | Delete a review |
