# üè† HBnB Project   

## Project Objective: HBNB Evolution - PART 1

The **HBNB Evolution** project is an advanced step in the development of a **fully functional AirBnB clone**, incorporating more robust and scalable features. The goal is to transition from a simple command-line interface to a fully interactive **web application**, integrating a **storage engine, a RESTful API, and a front-end interface**.

This project emphasizes **software architecture, database management, and web development**, allowing users to **create, update, delete, and manage places, users, reviews, and amenities**. It also introduces concepts of **data persistence**, improving efficiency with different storage options (file storage and database storage).

### Key Objectives:
- **Enhancing user experience** with a web-based UI.
- **Implementing a RESTful API** to facilitate communication between the front-end and back-end.
- **Optimizing data management** with an improved storage system.
- **Ensuring scalability and maintainability** through modular development and best coding practices.

By the end of this project, the system should be capable of handling real-world scenarios for an AirBnB-like platform, demonstrating a comprehensive understanding of full-stack development.

### üìç Project Scope  
**HBnB Evolution** is a simplified application inspired by Airbnb that allows users to:  
‚úîÔ∏è Register  
‚úîÔ∏è Add properties  
‚úîÔ∏è Associate amenities   
‚úîÔ∏è Submit reviews

## Business Rules and Requirements

### User Entity
- Each user has a **first name**, **last name**, **email**, and **password**.
- Users can be identified as **administrators** through a boolean attribute.
- Users should be able to **register**, **update** their profile information, and be **deleted**.

### Place Entity
- Each place has a **title**, **description**, **price**, **latitude**, and **longitude**.
- Places are associated with the **user** who created them (owner).
- Places can have a **list of amenities**.
- Places can be **created**, **updated**, **deleted**, and **listed**.

### Review Entity
- Each review is associated with a **specific place** and **user**, and includes a **rating** and **comment**.
- Reviews can be **created**, **updated**, **deleted**, and **listed by place**.

### Amenity Entity
- Each amenity has a **name** and **description**.
- Amenities can be **created**, **updated**, **deleted**, and **listed**.

### General Rules
- Each object should be uniquely identified by an **ID**.
- For audit reasons, the **creation** and **update datetime** should be recorded for all entities.

## General Architecture  

### **Package Diagram**  
The architecture follows a **layered model**, integrating the **facade pattern** to simplify interactions between components.  

```mermaid
classDiagram
class PresentationLayer {
    <<Interface>>
    +FrontendServices
    +API
}
class BusinessLogicLayer {
    +BaseModel
    +UserModel
    +PlaceModel
    +ReviewsModel
    +AmenityModel

}
class PersistenceLayer {
    +DatabaseAccess
}
PresentationLayer --> BusinessLogicLayer : Facade Pattern
BusinessLogicLayer --> PersistenceLayer : Database Operations
```

**The 3 main layers**:  

1Ô∏è‚É£ **Presentation Layer**  
- Manages the user interface and interactions.  
- Receives requests and returns responses after processing.  

2Ô∏è‚É£ **Business Logic Layer**  
- Contains key models (**User, Place, Review, Amenity**).  
- Implements business rules and orchestrates operations.  
- Acts as a **facade** for communication with the persistence layer.  

3Ô∏è‚É£ **Persistence Layer**  
- Manages the database and CRUD operations.  
- Structures data to ensure integrity and consistency.  

## üõ†Ô∏è Business Logic Layer  


### üìå **Class Diagram**  
The core of the application relies on several **key entities**:  

### High-Level Architecture - classDiagram
```mermaid
classDiagram
    class User {
        #UUID id
        +String firstName
        +String lastName
        +String email
        -String password
        -Boolean isAdmin
        +Date Creation
        +Date Updated
        +createUser()
        +updateUser()
        +deleteUser()
    }

    class Place {
        #UUID id
        +String title
        +String description
        +Float price
        +Float latitude
        +Float longitude
        +Date Creation
        +Date Updated
        +createPlace()
        +updatePlace()
        +deletePlace()
    }

    class Review {
        #UUID id
        +Int rating
        +String comment
        +Date Creation
        +Date Updated
        +createReview()
        +updateReview()
        +deleteReview()
    }

    class Amenity {
        #UUID id
        +String name
        +String description
        +Date Creation
        +Date Updated
        +createAmenity()
        +updateAmenity()
        +deleteAmenity()
    }

    User "1" -- "0..*" Place : owns
    User "1" -- "0..*" Review : submits
    Place "1" -- "0..*" Review : receives
    Place "1" -- "0..*" Amenity : has

```
### üîó **Entity Relationships**  
‚úîÔ∏è **A user** can own multiple **places** and leave multiple **reviews**.  
‚úîÔ∏è **A place** can receive multiple **reviews** and be associated with multiple **amenities**.  

The architecture of the business logic layer ensures **consistency, scalability, and modularity**.

2Ô∏è‚É£ It validates and forwards them to the **Business Logic Layer**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ After validation, the data is stored via the **Persistence Layer**.  
4Ô∏è‚É£ A success or failure response is returned.  

#### üè° **2. Place Creation**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The user submits a creation request (**title, description, etc.**).

4Ô∏è‚É£ A confirmation is returned.  

#### ‚≠ê **3. Review Submission**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The user wants to leave a review for a place.  
2Ô∏è‚É£ The **Presentation Layer** sends the details (**rating, comment, etc.**) to the **Business Logic Layer**.  
3Ô∏è‚É£ The review is stored via the **Persistence Layer**, and a response is returned.  

#### üìç **4. Retrieving Available Places**  
1Ô∏è‚É£ The user requests the list of available places.
